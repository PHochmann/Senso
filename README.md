# Senso

Senso is the German name for the popular game "Simon" in which you have to memorize a sequence of LED colors.
The repository is divided into "Senso" and "Senso Card".
The first is meant as a full implementation with score display, light-up arcade buttons and wooden enclosure.
The latter is a EC-card sized implementation, driven by a button cell with buttons and LEDs directly on the PCB.
